"This week marks the beginning of the fourth quarter of my senior year. Well actually the last quarter of my high school career. I can not believe I have made it almost 4  years of High School. These next few months are going to be filled with emotion. Emotions that will not be able to explained.  Those friends that you have spent your whole life, will part ways but not the memories. . . ..I guess it is just life... What can we do?

For all of those graduating:

<blockquote>"Make the most out of the rest of the your senior year. You're only a senior once!"</blockquote>
