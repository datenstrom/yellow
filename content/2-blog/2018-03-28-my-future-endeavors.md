<h3>Career</h3>
I am <strong>so excited</strong> to become a teacher down the road and spread my global awareness to my future students. Teachers are so needed to help build the next generation of students who will lead the way to a better future. Living in the world that we live in today, it is needed to learn another language, to love cultures and to love those people who are different from us. All this has me so stoked!
<h3>Pondering</h3>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Lately, I've been thinking about my future. I've been asking myself, ""what can I do to become more than just an ordinary teacher?"" I definitely want to be more well-rounded as a person. I'm not the type of person who is satisfied settling for one thing. I've been becoming the person who really wants to try new things and hope to see where such road takes me? Even though I should have minored in it at least, I still feel like I can be successful learning new skills. I want to start a new journey this summer in learning new skills. I want to leave my comfort zone and just do me? So what exactly am I doing?</p>

<h3>3 things</h3>
I decided that I want to learn and continue learning 3 things: learn the skills to graphic design, continue HTML/CSS &amp; other programming languages and learn to make a simple app. This is something I've always wanted to do for a while but was scared to start. I have received inspiration from people around me. This is gives me hope that even though I am only a beginner. Mastering all of these skills will take more than a summer. I have accepted this.

I also plan on being able to continuously read a book at all times. Knowledge will help me sooth the savage beast from driving me crazy.Â  I want to be able to grow the mind and soul in ways I haven't felt in a longtime.

<h3>Personal Growth</h3>
Overall, I want this to be my summer to help me grow, to enlighten me and overall, to help me become a better person. I won't just limit myself to the items mentioned above. I'm going to try all sorts of things. How I go about this will be all up to me. My attitude toward things will decide how bad or great my outcome will be. I know that things will be positive. I will face obstacles but I will overcome them. What matters is that I tried something new this summer.

I want to thank you for all of your support. I hope to be able to share my adventure as I go. Even though I am hoping to grow this summer, I want to let you know that you will also grow this summer. You and I will find the right path for a bright future."
