We're 9 days into the New Year of ~~2022~~ 2023. 

These last few years, I haven't been in the right mindset. I've been in a dark place for many, many years. This dark place has hindered me in so many aspects of my life. I don't know who I am anymore. It's been hard to love myself for as long as I remember. 

The keyword: **Avoiding**.

I hope my friends and family understand. I know I have hurt you in some form. I am really sorry. 

The past can't be changed. All I can hope is to learn from it and not be stuck in it. 

This year I am going to push through to improve myself. The things I want to do are not a deterrent to the problems at hand. I would like them to help guide me into finding clarity. To help point me in the direction of the light.  I am finally going to dedicate myself to formally learn a few programming languages and actually understand that missing disconnect/mental block. 

I'm going to start with Rust. A language I've been very interested in for many years. A language I've pick up for a while and would just stop out of no where. I hope to finally get some certifications in Google, Amazon Web Services, Artificial intelligence, front-end/back-end development. On top of all this, I'd like to start my Master's in Information Technology in Education.

I know I am capable of great things. I just hope I can acknowledge this. 

I promised to build something. It'll happen.  

The bigger issues need to be solved through other channels. I also acknowledge this. 


I guess I should try to work on my body too. 



That is all I got.
