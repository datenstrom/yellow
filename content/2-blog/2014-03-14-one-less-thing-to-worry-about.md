"Today in the mail i got a letter. A letter that put great joy in my life. I got a letter that I am getting full tuition off at UNK! Hard work finally does pay off. I want to thank those who read over my essay to make it stand out especially Mrs. Dunbar. Thank you for helping me emphasizing and going over my essay. THANK YOU! Scholarships really do help. Just keep trying to apply. Maybe you'll be in a surprise. I am having the best day of my life!!! I want to thank god also for this amazing gift! I am speechless.
