"This last week at Hastings High School.....

The Student Council hosted the District 3 Student Council Convention. Much work was put into for a the success of the convention. Our theme was Oh the Places You'll Go! by Dr. Seuss. Many area schools came to our event. Adams Central, Loup City, GICC, Kearney High and many more.

We intertwined social media in our event. We used twitter to use the hashtag: <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23hastingsd3"">#hastingsd3   </a>

to share thoughts and capture unforgettable moments at D3 Convention.

Click the hashtag to see some pictures and posts on twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23hastingsd3"">#hastingsd3</a>

#Selfies were were very popular.
