Hey, I'm Pablo and I'm based in Sacramento. I do IT and teach web design. Did you know I grew up in the town where [Kool-Aid](https://hastingsmuseum.org/exhibit/kool-aid/) was invented!? Oh, Yeahhhh! 

I really thankful for my parents that they taught me the importance of growing up bilingual which led me to become a polygot. I was a teacher. I can say 'Go Green' in 4 languages. ðŸŒŽ I speak English, Spanish & French. I also know some Korean as I studied the language and I recently traveled there.  

Speaking of the Korean language, I was in Korea this summer! [I documented my adventures](/korea)

I really like vinyls and film photography.

Currently working on a few tech projects: ECO, AI/ML, Node,

I like DCD's Jackpot Juicer.

Living in CA, I have grown so much and made amazing friends
